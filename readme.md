# Interaction through Python

### Learning goals
After this week, it is expected that you:

* can write python controls that get called as response to blender sensors
* can access the object and the sensor that called the python control
* understand when and how to have python access the logic actuators
* can build the logic bricks of a blender game programatically in python
* can use the different sensors and their settings for efficiency

## The main example
There is a major example - the little red box car we have been working with over the last few weeks. This week it is represented in the files `lost_red_car_backup.blend` and two python scripts: `BuildGame.py` that installs the missing parts to the blender file, and `CarGame.py` that has the run-time behaviour for the game (scoring).

## Explanation of the example
Will be given in class, and expanded here before thursday.

### Building the logic bricks from python
Once you find the right library it is reasonable to build them.

### The python control
In particular how to access the object to which the control is attached. 

### Acess to the sensor
Each of the sensors has some extra aspects which can be set and read from python.
